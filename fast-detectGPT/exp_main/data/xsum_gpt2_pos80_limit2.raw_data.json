        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There is",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's ethnic policy at",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat.

On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand.

The three-day event was launched by tourist body Welcome to Yorkshire after the county hosted the Tour de France Grand Depart in 2014. More than 1.2m people lined the 320-mile (515km) route. Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said.

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service. It said that bringing them back would improve response times by about four seconds for the first engine to reach the scene.

Last year the government announced plans to allow parents to share their maternity and paternity leave - changes are scheduled to come in April 2015. But the ILM said its research suggested the changes would have little impact if attitudes of employers were not addressed as well. \"The introduction of shared parental leave is a crucial step towards enabling more women to progress into senior roles,\" said Charles Elvin, ILM chief executive. \"Yet our research revealed cultural barriers are impeding the uptake of both two weeks statutory paternity leave and additional paternity leave.\" He said there remained a \"cultural expectation\" within organisations that women rather than men",

        "The Port Talbot-based Specific innovation centre is working on the concept of \"buildings as power stations\". The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years. Kevin Bygate, chief executive of Specific said the potential was to deliver a \"game changer\" on energy: not only for",

The researchers will take blood and saliva samples at six-monthly intervals over the 18 months of the study to measure biological markers of stress. They hope their work will reveal ways to prevent dementia. The results could offer clues to new treatments or better ways of managing the condition, they say. People who have mild cognitive impairment are at an increased risk of going on to develop dementia - although some will remain stable and others may improve. BBC Health: Dementia in depth And past work suggests mid-life stress may increase a person's risk of Alzheimer's disease.

There are already places where large numbers of viewers watch e-sports, but one analyst said the BBC's coverage could attract new viewers to the genre. Under the deal, the BBC will include broadcasts of exclusive editorial content from the Gfinity tournament in west London. The games to be played include fighting title Street Fighter V, first person shooter Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and robot football game Rocket League. Currently, online streaming channels Twitch and YouTube command the biggest audiences for e-sports, although events are also now being shown on conventional TV stations such as Ginx in the UK. The BBC has broadcast highlights of e-sports tournaments in the past, but said the Gfinity coverage would be \"on a much larger scale\". Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst at IHS, said the BBC would be able test the demand for e-sports on its network. \"It's correct",

Mr Malone said the problem appeared to be limited to Holy island, with users able to regain signal on the Anglesey mainland. He said more than 100 people had made complaints but no-one could get a firm answer on when the problem would be fixed.

The UK has accepted about 8,000 Syrian refugees since 2011, according to the UN. The US has taken just 12,000. And according to recent UN refugee agency data, no Syrian refugees have been resettled by China, Russia or any Gulf states.

Drone-based complaints include invasions of privacy, disputes between neighbours, near misses with aircraft and prison smuggling, said PA. The news agency said the total number of drone incidents was likely to be higher than the figure it had given because not every force it contacted with its Freedom of Information request responded. Growing use of drones could have a significant impact on personal privacy, Prof David Dunn, a politician scientist from the University of Birmingham, told PA. \"Previously you had a hedge, you had a wall and you could do whatever you wanted in your garden without people disturbing you,\" he said. \"That has changed because of drones.\" Many of the reports logged by forces involved arguments caused by drones being flown over gardens or for long periods of time near crowds.

However, it highlighted confusion among spectators about ticketing and criticised steel fencing at the site. Among changes planned for this year's event is scrapping of evening entertainment. The four-day weekend event in July 2015, run by TeamOrigin Events, marked the opening stage of the sailing series as Sir Ben Ainslie Racing (BAR) began Britain's bid to win the 35th America's Cup. While the Saturday events attracted about 100,000 spectators, racing was cancelled and the public viewing areas evacuated due to bad weather on Sunday. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were among those disappointed as racing was abandoned and there was criticism on social media over spectator provision.

The review found there was \"inadequate resource management\" during the verification and count between 23 May and 25 May. Jenny Watson, chair of the Electoral Commission, said the problems were down to a \"failure in planning\". \"There were delays in getting counting staff and counting agents appointed by parties into the venue, then there were insufficient staff to be able to recover from that,\" she said. \"Fundamentally that meant a local election count that had planned to take six hours took 23 and a half hours.\" She said the commission would be monitoring the council's response to the review.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: \"Safe staffing across all our hospitals and care homes is a crucial priority. \"The temporary changes announced today will ensure the NHS has the nurses it needs to deliver the highest standards of care without having to rely on rip-off staffing agencies that cost the taxpayer billions of pounds a year.\" The announcement comes after leading NHS figures warned that \"stringent\" immigration rules are preventing them from getting enough nurses on wards in time for winter.

The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme. There is also a surge in the number of people going to the bathroom, which leads to a spike in the use of water companies' pumps, which draw electricity.

Whiting added some of the controversial incidents last year related to this issue would potentially be treated differently were similar ones to occur in 2017. \"Before we said any move under braking would be investigated,\" Whiting said. \"Now, we have a simple, broad rule that says effectively if a driver moves erratically or goes unnecessarily slowly or behaves in a manner that could endanger another driver then he will be investigated.\" Whiting said the idea for a \"more general way of approaching things\" had come about as a result of a request from the teams, who are keen to have a more laissez-faire approach to policing racing incidents. \"They wanted less investigation and only cases where",

Young people in Indonesia, amused by the local buses' customised horns, have been waiting by the side of the road for vehicles to pass, encouraging bus drivers to toot their horn when they did so. Videos depicting this craze have gone viral in Indonesia. Some held signs to better attract the attention of the driver - signs which said 'Om Telolet Om'. 'Telolet' is a word representing the sound of the buses' horns, while 'om' is a term for an older male, like 'uncle' or 'sir' in English. So 'Om Telolet Om' roughly translates as 'Sir honk your horn sir'. OK, but what has that got to do with dance",

Lead researcher Dr Carlota Batres said men's preferences may adapt in tough environments so they mate with women best equipped to survive and reproduce. \"Our findings provide new evidence for the malleability of preferences depending on the environment,\" she said. \"We found that the weight preferences in prospective female partners changed in response to the harsher environment and then remained at the new level while the environment remained harsh. \"Such changes in preferences may be beneficial because they allow for increased opportunities to form partnerships with those who are better equipped to survive illness or uncertain food availability.\" Participants were asked to rate computer-generated female faces, which varied in apparent weight. For the control subjects - whose lives and environment did not change compared to baseline - there were no changes in their preferences. The army cadets' preference",
        "The manhunt began after a witness said the teenager, named as Marcel Hesse, had revealed his attack on the child on the messaging service Whatsapp. Pictures of the scene were also posted on the internet. Police in the western city of Bochum said the suspect had also boasted in a chat-room about murdering a woman. Although they could not confirm the second murder, investigators said the teenager had claimed the woman \"put up more of a fight than the child\" and weighed some 120kg (19 stone). The motive for his attack appeared to have been the woman's bank, computer and phone details. As the search for Marcel Hesse spread across the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia on Wednesday, a school was placed under lockdown for several hours some 30km (18 miles) away. Police in the town of Wetter said nothing suspicious was found. Children were told to play indoors at kindergartens in Herne, south of Bochum, where the boy died.

The case will go back to the organisation's appeal board on 24 May, when Best's conviction is likely to be overturned. However, the BHA insists it opposes other grounds for appeal and will effectively push for a retrial. \"Having received further details concerning the appeal, and having taken advice, we have decided not to contest the appeal on the grounds of apparent bias.

Reda al-Hamamy, a retired Egyptian police general, said his son was not a terrorist and accused the soldier who fired of \"using brute force with a poor young man\".

The result of the strike ballot was announced last week, with more than two-thirds of Unison members saying they were prepared to take action. The Department of Health said the NHS couldn't afford the union's demands. The government has given NHS staff a 1% pay rise, but not for those who get automatic progression-in-the-job increases. Those increases are given to about half of staff and are worth 3% a year on average. The decision by ministers went against the recommendation of the independent pay review board, which called for an across-the-board rise.

About 30 insurgents died in the attack, with Hamidullin the only survivor, while no American or Afghan soldiers were killed. Hamidullin, who did not testify during the trial, is expected to be sentenced on 6 November. Lawyers say it is unusual for someone captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan to be transferred to the United States for trial in a federal court.

It also found schools had more influence than parents in giving confidence in understanding politics. Those aged 16 and 17 were able to vote in the referendum on 18 September, the first UK ballot to include them. Researchers at dpart gathered evidence from two surveys of under 18s - one conducted in April and May 2013, and then a second conducted one year later. More than 1,000 young people responded to each survey. They found under 18s were at least as interested in politics as adults. Only 7% had never talked about the referendum with anyone. Young people were less likely than adults to align themselves with political parties, but the proportion who said they did not feel an affinity to one dropped in the year before the vote, from 57% to 51%. Parents had a strong influence in encouraging young people to vote, but had less",

        "A study, in the British Medical Journal, showed a sudden fall in antidepressant prescriptions and a rise in suicide attempts after media reports of the connection. The team at Harvard Medical School said the unintended effect was \"disturbing\". Experts said similar changes had been seen in other countries. In 2003, there were concerns about an increased suicide risk from some antidepressants. It led to the US Food and Drug Administration changing the medicine warnings and widespread media reports. However, there was concern that the reports were exaggerated and missed out the benefits of antidepressants. The study, which followed 2.5 million teenagers and young adults between 2000 and 2010, showed an immediate impact of the warnings. Prescriptions fell by a third in teenagers and by a quarter in young adults. The number of suicide attempts increased by 22% in teenagers and 34% in young adults. Overall it led to an additional 77 attempts, the researchers estimated. The report concluded: \"It is disturbing that after the health advisories, warnings and media reports about the relation between antidepressant use and suicidality in",

Free speech advocates criticised Harvard's actions saying the punishment was \"draconian\". Information about Harvard's actions was reported by the Crimson - the main student newspaper at the prestigious college. The obscene material was posted to a chat forum on Facebook that grew out of a messaging group set up by students due to start studying at Harvard this year.

He died 3,000 years ago aged 19. \"Clearly it does look from the radar evidence as if the tomb continues, as I have predicted,\" Mr Reeves said at a press conference with the Egyptian Antiquities Minister Mamdouh al-Damati on Saturday, AFP reports. \"The radar, behind the north wall [of Tutankhamun's burial chamber] seems pretty clear.

Mr Damati said the scans would now be sent to Japan for further analysis. Dr Reeves developed his theory after the Spanish artistic and preservation specialists, Factum Arte, were commissioned to produce detailed scans of Tutankhamun's tomb. The",

Although renewables are on the cusp in most major European states (excluding Poland) for many more years now, they represent an even larger percentage for Europe. In fact, they're now a minority. The Renew, Not Efficient Project will be an ambitious but ultimately unplayable vision which, if correctly implemented in reality will be a major political achievement for both parties. It is due",

        "Denis Donaldson was murdered in County Donegal in April 2006, months after being exposed as an agent who worked for the police and MI5 for more than 50 years. The death triggered the rise to national sympathy, many claiming he murdered the young British girl.\n\nIn a subsequent media battle in 2013 Michael Trump told his supporters about MI5 and then admitted his boss had done this to him as part of a deal that included \"some pretty serious political abuse of young British people\".
