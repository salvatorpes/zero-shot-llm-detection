        "Discovery is the act of detecting something new, or something previously unrecognized as meaningful. With reference to sciences and academic disciplines, discovery is the observation of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations with previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experiences. A discovery may sometimes be based on earlier discoveries, collaborations, or ideas. Some discoveries represent a radical breakthrough in knowledge or technology. New discoveries are acquired through various senses and are usually assimilated, merging with pre-existing knowledge and actions. Questioning is a major form of human thought and interpersonal communication, and plays a key role in discovery. Discoveries are often made due to questions. Some discoveries lead to the invention of objects, processes, or techniques. A discovery may sometimes be based on earlier discoveries, collaborations or ideas, and the process of discovery requires at least the awareness that an existing concept or method can be modified or transformed. However, some discoveries also represent a radical breakthrough",

The simple answer is that there is a lot of money to be made by charging fees to facilitate the trading of securities, but there are other factors at play here relating to new technologies.

There are a number of reasons for this rapid increase in volumes. Most significant would be the introduction of new technologies that allow for high volume, high frequency trading. This increase in activity has be accompanied by an increase in the number of stock exchanges.

Type systems formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types, data structures, or other components (e.g. \"string\", \"array of float\", \"function returning boolean\"). Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages and built into interpreters and compilers, although the type system of a language can be extended by optional tools that perform added checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar.

To be found guilty of a crime at trial , the jury must unanimously decide that the prosecution has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt . To be found liable for civil penalties , the standard is much lower and thus much easier to meet . So to put it as simply as possible , if the prosecution can prove that a defendant \" probably did it \" , that is n't good enough in a criminal trial , but it is good enough in a civil trial .",

If we label each bean A , B , C , and D respectively , we will find that the most likely situation is to have two beans in each container . The least likely situation is to have all four beans in either of the containers . For example , if we choose the left container , there is only one way for all four beans to be in the left container , but there are 6 possible ways that two beans can be in each container . Two",

These programs can either be participatory or demonstrative and are typically directed by a host, sharing the rules of the program as well as commentating and narrating where necessary. The history of game shows dates back to the invention of television as a medium. On most game shows, contestants either have to answer questions or solve puzzles, typically to win either money or prizes. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor.",

B and G pawns open only bishops , which is more viable because then you can attack rooks , or even king 's position . However , it still makes castling less beneficial . C and F pawns expose your king or queen and potentially block your knights .

        "Let me ask you another question: if that person stayed at home and made a widget instead, would exporting that widget benefit his home country? There is no difference, economically, between the two situations. A foreign worker sending home remittances is no different from a local manufacturer exporting their products. Both are earning export dollars for themselves and their home countries. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Clearly, the answer is yes - this is a good thing or a bad thing but we cannot know which in isolation. However, in general, foreign worker remittances are overwhelmingly beneficial for the host (which gets work done that otherwise would not be done) and the source (which gets export income. With reference to your particular question about local inflation, a rise in exports causes appreciation in the exchange rate i.e. local currency becomes more expensive with respect to (in this case) the Euro. Appreciation in the exchange rate actually puts downward pressure on inflation. However, the absence of our worker from the local economy puts",

        "Can they change the weights? Yes. Will they? It depends. are ETF's fixed from their inception to their de-listing? It's actually not possible for weights to be fixed, since different assets have different returns. So the weights are constantly changing as long as the market is moving. Usually after a certain period or a substantial market move, fund managers would rebalance and bring the weights back to a certain target. The target weights - what your question is really about - aren't necessarily the same as the initial weights, but often times they are. It depends on the objective of the ETF (which is stated in prospectus). In your example, if the manager drops the weight of the most volatile one, the returns of the ETF and the 5 stocks could be substantially different in the next period. This is not desirable when the ETFs objective is to track performance of those 5 stocks. Most if not all ETFs are passively-managed. The managers don't get paid",

Other compounds that act on GABA receptors include the benzodiazepines , like Xanax , which are used to treat anxiety . The effects of alcohol on anxiety tend to come into perceivable effect at lower doses than those that affect physical coordination . Basically , alcohol acts",

This means that if the company keeps up this earning you should expect to make 10% yearly on your investment, long term. The stock price may fluctuate, but if the company keeps on making money you will eventually do so too as investor. If the EPS is low it means that the market expects the earnings to rise in the future, either because the company has a low profit margin that can be vastly improved, or because the business is expected to grow.

If you want to short a stock and your broker is rejecting your order because they can't find shares to short, then I would recommend that you continue placing that order throughout the day. You might get lucky and submit one of those orders right after someone else has covered their short and before anyone else can enter a short. I have had success doing this in the past.",

If you actively invest, I recommend the Core & Satellite approach: invest most of your money in a well diversified basket of stocks via index funds and actively manage a small portion of your account. Carefully track the expenses and returns of the active portion of your account and see if you are one of the lucky few that can generate excess returns.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.It could only be known by clinical examination of the lump by your family physician/general surgeon whether it is a lymph node or a hernia. A hernia would be reducible unless it has become irreducible, and also the location would be different. Straining might increase the size of a hernia, but would not cause any difference to a lymph node swelling. If the lymphadenitis is due to some kind of infection being spread by any of the draining areas like the lower limb, or genitalia, it might get smaller and relieved by anti inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, but there would be no effect on hernia by these. At the end I would advise you to get yourself assessed by your family physician or a general surgeon to be certain of the aetiology of the lump.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

In a helicopter , the \" wings \" , aka rotor blades , are moved through the air by virtue of the fact that they rotate . Other than this , they create lift in the same way as an aeroplane wing . A complicated system of pulleys adjusts the angles of each of the blades as they rotate , depending on which portion of their rotation they are on . The pilot adjusts this system to make the helicopter go where he wants . For example , by making the blade have a higher angle when it 's at the rear of the helicopter , you get more lift on the rear part of the rotor than the front part , which makes the whole rotor (",

Predictable elements are easy to learn and play and may well become familiar tunes, while those which are surprising are harder to play but may well become classics. The musicians themselves are often interested in producing both kinds of music. We found that the students were interested in producing predictable music that they would feel they could teach through to another person, but also in exploring other kinds of music including less familiar forms (e.g., improvisations, nonlinear tonalities), that could become more interesting to an audience. So, for example, in a piece where the students had to arrange a set of eight short segments of piano music, there were two different approaches: students either took a very predictable route and repeated the same music over and over again to create a 'cascading' effect - or the students created something that was a little bit more surprising [for example, they",

Therefore, we can say that with each unit of time that the car is slowing down in time units, it experiences a change ( deceleration ) in velocity which is equal to the net force acting",
        "Cancer is an abnormal, uncontrolled growth of your own cells in the body. This can occur anywhere. The main problem is that cancer does not consist of one abnormal cell, but a number of abnormal cells which have started to multiply.\nThe cancer cells can grow slowly and may not cause any harm at all. However, sooner or later, cancerous cells will gain the ability to spread and cause more and more damage.\nThe good news is that cancer is not always an immediate threat to your life! It can be treated or controlled for as long as you want. However, the sooner its treatment starts, the better the chances for recovery. Once the cancer spreads (metastasis), that is much harder to treat.\nYour risk of getting cancer depends on your own individual personal risk, which is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors . Of course, no one can control what happens at birth. However, many cancer types can be prevented by preventing risk factors",

So a dishonest parent can lie to the child all day long, and at bedtime the child will believe the lie. If the parent is abusive - physically, verbally and/or emotionally - the child can be a wonderful lie as well. This situation is all too often used to control the child. The child is punished for speaking out against the parent, and is rewarded for staying in line. In reality, the child is being punished for being a person who has to think and be independent in order to survive.

Secondly, when the price of the stock is low, you might not have enough of a share of ownership to be an equity holder. When you hold 100 shares of company A, for example, the more money you need to put in before you buy those shares, the more you are paying for equity. On the other hand, if company A is a market cap stock, you are paying a fairly small amount for a portion of its earnings in the present, but if the stock is down, you might not technically have a proportion of ownership of company A--you are probably paying a price of more than 100x earnings, not only for that part of the company, but the whole company as well.\nMy point, though, is that the price of a stock may have more to do with its underlying assets and its debt, rather than an estimation of the profits",

A second option is to put the file on a central server and let your clients download it that way.

You might configure one directory to allow download speeds of about 20 Mb/s, but no download larger than 100 megabits. The same control can be available for upload speeds.

Binocular disparity works by comparing the image of the world made by each of your eyes. Your brain can then compare these two images to help you determine the position of an object. The binocular disparity is measured by the difference in distance between your eyes.\nBecause there is a difference in binocular disparity between each of the eyes, the farther apart your eyes are, the greater the disparity is between the images.

So the main action of gastric emptying is what comes from the brain, which stimulates the pylorgenogastric sphincter to open and then closes it, so its just that when you are sick, the pylorgenogastric sphincter stays open and this gives us the effect of feeling full faster than normal when your",

Uranium-233 has a neutron count that is 1 neutron more than the Uranium-235 isotope. The difference in the neutron count has profound consequences in nuclear fission. In general, when a nuclear weapon is detonated, each of the Uranium-235 atoms produces two free neutrons that can go on to split other Uranium-235 atoms. A Uranium-233 atom will also produce neutrons as it fissions, but only one of those neutrons will go on to split another Uranium-233 atom. If the first fission event is in a larger Uranium-235 atom (the equivalent of a 9-inch brick in a 3-inch brick wall), there is a greater probability of splitting additional Uranium-",
