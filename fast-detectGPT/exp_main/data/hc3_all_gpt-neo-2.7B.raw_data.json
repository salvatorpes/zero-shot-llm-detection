        "You will often receive a lower bill if you simply wait for a second or third billing statement. I was once given the advice to never pay a medical bill until after they had sent three notices, because they will almost certainly reduce the amount due. Sounds crazy, right? I have excellent credit, so the idea of risking it by ignoring bills disturbed me greatly, and I scoffed at the advice. I then had a similar experience to you, and decided to take the advice. By the third statement, the bill was reduced to less than half of the original, with zero intervention on my part. I then paid it without any impact to my credit whatsoever. I've since done that every time I receive healthcare services, and the bill is always reduced on subsequent statements, generally to less than half of the original bill. Sometimes it's because insurance finally got around to paying. Sometimes a",
        "Hello and Welcome to \u2018Ask A Doctor\u2019 service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As you have told me, your husband is suffering from racing thoughts, this might be a part of his personality which is right from his childhood causing racing thoughts and also behaving based on those thoughts. One modality of getting better from this is to regularly exercise at least 2 to 3 days per week and have regular walks in the morning time so that the neurotransmitter levels in the brain get normal and the neurotransmitters responsible for pleasure also increases in his brain so that he feels better, then his racing thoughts will come down. If he still has a problem then short term mood stabilizers can be taken which will help him feel better regarding his racing thoughts. I hope I have solved your query. Feel free to ask any further questions.Thank you",

More precisely, the sample complexity is the number of training-samples that we need to supply to the algorithm, so that the function returned by the algorithm is within an arbitrarily small error of the best possible function, with probability arbitrarily close to 1. There are two variants of sample complexity: The No free lunch theorem, discussed below, proves that, in general, the strong sample complexity is infinite, i.e. that there is no algorithm that can learn the globally-optimal target function using a finite number of training samples. However, if we are only interested in a particular class of target functions (e.g, only linear functions) then the sample complexity is finite, and it depends linearly on the VC dimension on the class of target functions.",

        "Fire insurance, as you have discovered, is a complete ripoff. Most people pay fire insurance all their lives with no benefit whatsoever, and those such as yourself who are lucky enough to get a payout find that it is completely insufficient to replace their loss. I once computed the actual beneficial net present financial value of my fire insurance policy and it came out to $40 per month. The cost was $800 per month. That is typical. Homeowners pay $500 to $800 per year for something that is worth $30 to $50 per year. Ironically banks would actually make more money from mortgages if they did not require mortgagees to buy insurance, but nevertheless they insist on it. It is not about logic, but about fear and irrationality. When I paid off my mortgage and gained ownership of my home the first thing I did was cancel my fire insurance.

Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. Intuitively, given that a document is about a particular topic, one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently: \"dog\" and \"bone\" will appear more often in documents about dogs, \"cat\" and \"meow\" will appear in documents about cats, and \"the\" and \"is\" will appear approximately equally in both. A document typically concerns multiple topics in different proportions; thus, in a document that is 10% about cats and 90% about dogs, there would probably be about 9 times more dog words than cat words. The \"topics\" produced by topic modeling techniques are clusters of similar words.

For instance, a large public company that contracts with a smaller supplier or service company, also public, might make a tender offer below market price. The market will look at this price and the business relationship, and wonder what the larger company knows about the smaller one that they don't. Now, what happens when investors lose confidence in a stock? They sell it, supply goes up, demand goes down, and the price drops. The company making the tender offer can then get its shares either way; directly via the offer, or on the open market. This is, however, usually not successful beyond the very short term, and typically only works because the company making a tender offer is the 800-pound gorilla, which can dictate its own terms with practically anyone else it meets.

Credit cards have high rates of interest which you have to pay unless you pay the credit off every month. Therefore, increasing your total credit capacity should not be your concern. Since internet technology lets you pay off your balance in minutes online, there is no reason to have multiple cards in order to avoid running out of a balance. If, on the other hand, you do not pay your existing card off every month, than getting another card can be even more dangerous, since you're increasing the amount of debt you take on.

The typical example is in propositional logic, wherein a compound statement is constructed using individual statements connected by logical connectives; if the truth value of the compound statement is entirely determined by the truth value(s) of the constituent statement(s), the compound statement is called a truth function, and any logical connectives used are said to be truth functional. Classical propositional logic is a truth-functional logic, in that every statement has exactly one truth value which is either true or false, and every logical connective is truth functional (with a correspondent truth table), thus every compound statement is a truth function.

The embodiment of the robot, situated in a physical embedding, provides at the same time specific difficulties (e.g. high-dimensionality, real time constraints for collecting data and learning) and opportunities for guiding the learning process (e.g. sensorimotor synergies, motor primitives). Example of skills that are targeted by learning algorithms include sensorimotor skills such as locomotion, grasping, active object categorization, as well as interactive skills such as joint manipulation of an object with a human peer, and linguistic skills such as the grounded and situated meaning of human language. Learning can happen either through autonomous self-exploration or through guidance from a human teacher, like for example in robot learning by imitation. Robot learning can be closely related to adaptive control, reinforcement learning as well as",

There is absolutely no requirement that one of them didn't offer too much or demand too little, so this is nearly meaningless as an indication of what anyone else will be willing to offer or demand. An average of trades across a sufficiently large number of transactions might indicate a rough consensus about the value of a stock, but transactions will be clustered around that average and the average itself moves over time. Either you offer to sell or buy at a particular price, wait for that price, and risk the transaction not taking place at all if nobody agrees, or you do a spot transaction and get the best price at that nanosecond (which may not be the best in the next nanosecond).

Increased risk means the lender must charge more. That's why home loans are cheap compared to loans for other purposes. Home loans are secured by the house. Houses are assets that hold and usually retain some value. Houses are easy to track down (they can't be hidden or moved) in the event that you don't repay your loan.

In other words, non-monotonic logics are devised to capture and represent defeasible inferences (cf. defeasible reasoning), i.e., a kind of inference in which reasoners draw tentative conclusions, enabling reasoners to retract their conclusion(s) based on further evidence. Most studied formal logics have a monotonic entailment relation, meaning that adding a formula to a theory never produces a pruning of its set of conclusions. Intuitively, monotonicity indicates that learning a new piece of knowledge cannot reduce the set of what is known. A monotonic logic cannot handle various reasoning tasks such as reasoning by default (conclusions may be derived only because of lack of evidence of the contrary), abductive reasoning (conclusions are only deduced as",

A theory is a consistent, relatively-self-contained body of knowledge which usually contains an axiomatic system and all its derived theorems. An axiomatic system that is completely described is a special kind of formal system. A formal theory is an axiomatic system (usually formulated within model theory) that describes a set of sentences that is closed under logical implication. A formal proof is a complete rendition of a mathematical proof within a formal system.",

        "Default logic is a non-monotonic logic proposed by Raymond Reiter to formalize reasoning with default assumptions. Default logic can express facts like \u201cby default, something is true\u201d; by contrast, standard logic can only express that something is true or that something is false. This is a problem because reasoning often involves facts that are true in the majority of cases but not always. A classical example is: \u201cbirds typically fly\u201d. This rule can be expressed in standard logic either by \u201call birds fly\u201d, which is inconsistent with the fact that penguins do not fly, or by \u201call birds that are not penguins and not ostriches and ... fly\u201d, which requires all exceptions to the rule to be specified. Default logic aims at formalizing inference rules like this one without explicitly mentioning all their exceptions.",

It is most often referred to as diagnosis with the medical context being implicit. The information required for diagnosis is typically collected from a history and physical examination of the person seeking medical care. Often, one or more diagnostic procedures, such as medical tests, are also done during the process. Sometimes posthumous diagnosis is considered a kind of medical diagnosis. Diagnosis is often challenging because many signs and symptoms are nonspecific. For example, redness of the skin (erythema), by itself, is a sign of many disorders and thus does not tell the healthcare professional what is wrong. Thus differential diagnosis, in which several possible explanations are compared and contrasted, must be performed. This involves the correlation of various pieces of information followed by the recognition and differentiation of patterns. Occasionally the process is made easy",

For estimating the tax liability, I would not use the effective rate but rather use the rate for your highest tax bracket and apply that to your estimated hobby income, assuming that you primary job income won't be wildly higher or lower than last year. As @keshlam noted in a comment, this income is coming on top of whatever else you earn, so it will be taxed at your top rate. Finally, I'd check again whether this is really \"hobby\" income or if it is \"self-employment\" income. Self-employment income will be subject to self-employment tax, which comes on top of the regular income tax.",

So once operation is done part of brain tissue would be removed.Like any wound in body which when heals will left with scar ,it is the same thing in brain which is called as gliosis. Gliosis is a process of scarring in the central nervous system. It results from the proliferation of astrocytes in an injured or diseased part of the brain, causing the formation of a fibrous glial scar. Although they are a necessary element to injury recovery, both the accumulation of glial cells and subsequent scarring are important markers of neurological damage.Scar cannot be removed ,it produce headache and seizure",

Noise rejection is the ability of a circuit to isolate an undesired signal component from the desired signal component, as with common-mode rejection ratio. All signal processing devices, both analog and digital, have traits that make them susceptible to noise. Noise can be random with an even frequency distribution (white noise), or frequency-dependent noise introduced by a device's mechanism or signal processing algorithms. In electronic systems, a major type of noise is hiss created by random electron motion due to thermal agitation. These agitated electrons rapidly add and subtract from the output signal and thus create detectable noise. In the case of photographic film and magnetic tape, noise (both visible and audible) is introduced due to the grain structure of the medium. In photographic film, the size of the grains in the film determines the film's sensitivity,",

        "In the philosophy of logic, a rule of inference, inference rule or transformation rule is a logical form consisting of a function which takes premises, analyzes their syntax, and returns a conclusion (or conclusions). For example, the rule of inference called modus ponens takes two premises, one in the form \"If p then q\" and another in the form \"p\", and returns the conclusion \"q\". The rule is valid with respect to the semantics of classical logic (as well as the semantics of many other non-classical logics), in the sense that if the premises are true (under an interpretation), then so is the conclusion. Typically, a rule of inference preserves truth, a semantic property. In many-valued logic, it preserves a general designation. But a rule of inference's action is purely syntactic, and does not need to preserve any semantic property: any function from sets of formulae to formulae counts as a rule of inference. Usually only rules that are recursive are important; i.e. rules such",

After that. under the US Uniform Commerical Code they are considered \"stale checks\" and banks need not accept them. My experience is that they generally won't -- but you probably shouldn't count on that, either when figuring out whether to try depositing an old check or figuring out how much cash you need to keep in your checking account to cover recent stale checks. The check you now hold is certainly a statement of intent to pay you and thus is a useful document to supplement other evidence that they still owe you the money -- but since checks can be cancelled and/or a replacement check may have been issued, its value for that purpose may be limited. You can try depositing it and see what happens. If that doesn't work (or you don't want to bother trying it) you can contact the retirement plan,",

If the asset appreciation is realized, meaning you've sold the asset and actually collected liquidity from it, then Derek_6424246 has provided a good route to follow. However, if the gains are unrealized, meaning only that the current value of the underlying asset(s) have increased or decreased, then you might want to record this under an Income:Unrealized Gains account. One of the main distinctions between the two are whether or not you have a taxable event (realized) or just want to better track your net worth at a given time (unrealized). For example, I generally track my retirement accounts increase in value sans interest, dividends and contributions, as income from an Income:Unrealized Gains account. I can still reconcile it with my statements, and it shows an accurate picture for my net worth, but the money is not liquid nor taxed and is more for informational purposes than anything.

With used cars you usually don't know how much they have invested in the car, so it's more difficult to know how low they're willing to go. Regardless, I do think it's odd that they would knock 2K off the price if you finance with them, but not if you pay cash. The only reason they would do that is if they intend to make at least 2K in interest over the life of the loan, but they have no way of guaranteeing you won't refi.

Life science is alternatively known as biology, and physical science is subdivided into branches: physics, chemistry, earth science, and astronomy.

Right now, the price of gold has been rising, because of fears of \"easing\" Fed monetary policy (for the past decade), culminating in recent \"quantitative easing.\" In the 1980s, you should have had 0% in gold given the fall of gold in 1981 because of Paul Volcker's monetary tightening policies, and other reasons.

        "Neuromorphic engineering, also known as neuromorphic computing, is the use of electronic circuits to mimic neuro-biological architectures present in the nervous system. A neuromorphic computer/chip is any device that uses physical artificial neurons (made from silicon) to do computations. In recent times, the term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog, digital, mixed-mode analog/digital VLSI, and software systems that implement models of neural systems (for perception, motor control, or multisensory integration). The implementation of neuromorphic computing on the hardware level can be realized by oxide-based memristors, spintronic memories, threshold switches, transistors, among others. Training software-based neuromorphic systems of spiking neural networks can be achieved using error backpropagation, e.g., using Python based frameworks such as snnTorch,[10] or using canonical learning rules from the biological learning literature, e.g., using BindsNet.[11] A key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of individual neurons, circuits, applications, and overall architectures creates desirable computations, affects",

        "Imaging radar is an application of radar which is used to create two-dimensional images, typically of landscapes. Imaging radar provides its light to illuminate an area on the ground and take a picture at radio wavelengths. It uses an antenna and digital computer storage to record its images. In a radar image, one can see only the energy that was reflected back towards the radar antenna. The radar moves along a flight path and the area illuminated by the radar, or footprint, is moved along the surface in a swath, building the image as it does so. Digital radar images are composed of many dots. Each pixel in the radar image represents the radar backscatter for that area on the ground: brighter areas represent high backscatter, darker areas represents low backscatter. The traditional application of radar is to display the position and motion of typically highly reflective objects (such as aircraft or ships) by sending out a radiowave signal, and then detecting the direction and delay of the reflected signal.

        "In artificial intelligence, an intelligent agent (IA) is anything which perceives its environment, takes actions autonomously in order to achieve goals, and may, if the situation is appropriate, attempt to communicate with its environment. We are currently in an era where artificial intelligence is now in the forefront in solving various problems faced by humanity. Examples of today's applications are personal assistants, Internet of things devices, etc. The goal of an intelligent system is to have a system able to interact intelligently with its environment. The interaction can be one of two main types: the first being simple interaction, and the second being more complex interaction. The first type of interaction is usually referred to with the terms \u201ccommand and control\u201d. An intelligent agent (IA) can act either by sending a command to an agent or by receiving a command from an agent. Both types of interaction, command and control and intelligent (non-command) interaction, are what we mean by intelligent or autonomous interactions.\nThe",

Whenever the other animal feels powerless to continue , the dominating animal will psychologically feel frustrated, and so may develop physical illnesses and emotional disorders.

This is because our species is the only one to have evolved such powerful instincts of independence. The instinct for dominance is a very real factor of dogs' personalities and actions; however, it is not always in a state of overt dominance; it can be the expression of a dominant psychological function .

        "A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process \u2014 that is, it evolves but with constant transition probabilities between successive states (that is, successive hidden states). An HMM is a stochastic model for time series by means of hidden Markov models (HMMs) and is often used to analyze signals that have significant random content in the form of noise. The parameters of an HMM may be estimated by maximum likelihood by assuming that the signal being modeled is stationary. For time series analysis, state space models (SSM) combine HMMs with time-series analysis techniques. However, SSMs have various disadvantages such as increased complexity and sensitivity to initial parameters.\nA time series model is a non-stationary model. It is considered a stochastic model as there is no assumption of stationarity. However, the use of HMMs with hidden states as the basis of the time series",

The automation may, for example, help the driver of a vehicle to maneuver through an intersection and avoid collisions with other vehicles, keep the vehicle under control in a cornering situation, turn a steering wheel, change vehicle speed or speed of a vehicle, etc. The automated functions can make a substantial contribution to safety for the operators of vehicles by improving vehicle handling and driving experience. The automation can also be used in conjunction with safety systems and functions related to vehicle operation and can help to reduce",

The authors concluded:\n\n\u201cUsing the long/short method [for calculating the returns], we find that the return on US equity index funds, the S&P 500 index funds over the period 1995\u20132004, the S&P 500 index, and the Russell 1000 index remain essentially zero after controlling for portfolio turnover.\"\n\nThe main conclusion to be derived from this study and the more recent one published by Fama\u2013French that the results have a very different view of commodity futures than the present study, and that it is not worth having a commodity",

This is due to hardware constraints such as energy efficiency, communication and computation power, which are not present in cellular-based systems[@b1][@b2][@b3].

For other noise issues - then you need to get appropriate specialist.\n\nFor tinnitus - You should do some basic work. For other noises issues - then you get correct specialist.\n\nI think, as your question is related to hearing loss & we know how important it is in the first instance.\n\nYour question could be answered with \"It depends - it might or might not\"\n\nIf not, kindly ask for proper specialist and go for an appropriate one.\n\nOne can try hearing aids and other noise reducing devices.

        "Imaging radar is an application of radar which is used to create two-dimensional images, typically of landscapes. Imaging radar provides its light to illuminate an area by illuminating the entire area from the sky in different directions. The light, typically at multiple radar frequencies, is modulated in a manner so that only a few frequency channels are used to receive the images from the various beams. The images are combined to produce a two-dimensional radar image.\nRadiometric problems include the calibration of imaging radar. In order to avoid errors in the measurements caused by variations in the sensitivity of the receiver detectors, radiometric calibration is performed. Typically, a reference signal such as the signal transmitted by a transmitting radar, from either a single transmitting radar or a transmitting radar array, is used to calibrate the radar system receivers by measuring the same reference or reference signal from the same transmitting radar at different locations. After determining the range of the reference signal (the difference in range from the reference signal in the transmitting radar",
        "In probability theory, conditional independence describes situations wherein an observation is irrelevant or redundant when evaluating the certainty of a hypothesis. Conditional independence is usually formulated in terms of a given probability measure space, which contains the entire probability mass associated with some unknown probability distribution.\n\nThe probability space is formed by defining a random variable, and then constructing a probability measure by assigning probabilities to all realizations from a probability space, with respect to any probability measure on the measurable subsets of a probability space. Conditional probability is the probability of the event occurring when knowing the values of independent random variables. The simplest application is the definition of independence of random variables within a given probability space, and this is the definition that we will be concerned with in this article. (An introduction to probability theory is provided by Jaynes Theorem).\n\nThe definition of conditional probability follows from Bayes' theorem. Suppose that we had observed a sequence of random variables. We take the probability distribution of these random variables to be known",
