With reference to sciences and academic disciplines, discovery is the observation of new phenomena, new actions, or new events and providing new reasoning to explain the knowledge gathered through such observations with previously acquired knowledge from abstract thought and everyday experiences. A discovery may sometimes be based on earlier discoveries, collaborations, or ideas. Some discoveries represent a radical breakthrough in knowledge or technology. New discoveries are acquired through various senses and are usually assimilated, merging with pre-existing knowledge and actions. Questioning is a major form of human thought and interpersonal communication, and plays a key role in discovery. Discoveries are often made due to questions.

Dividends are basically disbursal of company's profits to its shareholders. By holding stocks of a company, you become eligible to receiving dividends proportional to your ownership in the company. Dividends though are not guaranteed, as the company may incur losses or the management may decide to use the cash for future growth instead of disbursing it to the shareholders. For example, let's say a company called ABC Inc, is listed on NYSE and has a total of 1 million shares issued.

Kind of hard to be great when the bar is set so low . Carter also had issues with his brother who , by the media , was portrayed as the stereotypical redneck . Carter also had the disadvantage of having the first fully televised Presidency .

It's actually not possible for weights to be fixed, since different assets have different returns. So the weights are constantly changing as long as the market is moving. Usually after a certain period or a substantial market move, fund managers would rebalance and bring the weights back to a certain target. The target weights - what your question is really about - aren't necessarily the same as the initial weights, but often times they are. It depends on the objective of the ETF (which is stated in prospectus). In your example, if the manager drops the weight of the most volatile one, the returns of the ETF and the 5 stocks could be substantially different in the next period.

        "Earnings per share is the company profit (or loss), divided by the number of outstanding shares. The number should always be compared to the share price, so for instance if the EPS is $1 and the share price is $10, the EPS is 10% of the share price. This means that if the company keeps up this earning you should expect to make 10% yearly on your investment, long term. The stock price may fluctuate, but if the company keeps on making money you will eventually do so too as investor. If the EPS is low it means that the market expects the earnings to rise in the future, either because the company has a low profit margin that can be vastly improved, or because the business is expected to grow. Especially the last case may be a risky investment as you will lose money",

But what's also true is that a lot more people are covering their shorts during regular trading hours than in the pre-market. For stocks that have difficulty in finding shares to short, any time someone covers a short is an opportunity for you to enter a short. If you want to short a stock and your broker is rejecting your order because they can't find shares to short, then I would recommend that you continue placing that order throughout the day. You might get lucky and submit one of those orders right after someone else has covered their short and before anyone else can enter a short. I have had success doing this in the past.",

West Berlin , being way into the border of East Germany , was a democratic safe haven for anyone wishing to defect . So a wall was put around the entirety of West Berlin , so no more defections would occur . The wall coming down meant a beginning to reunification of Germany , and a desire to give up on communism , and move to a capitalistic society for all of Germany . In the meantime , the USSR also crumbled , and were in no position to resist the wall coming down . The wall coming down was literal and symbolic of capitalism winning over communism .",

If you actively invest, I recommend the Core & Satellite approach: invest most of your money in a well diversified basket of stocks via index funds and actively manage a small portion of your account. Carefully track the expenses and returns of the active portion of your account and see if you are one of the lucky few that can generate excess returns.

Straining might increase the size of a hernia, but would not cause any difference to a lymph node swelling. If the lymphadenitis is due to some kind of infection being spread by any of the draining areas like the lower limb, or genitalia, it might get smaller and relieved by anti inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, but there would be no effect on hernia by these.

When an object is dropped from a height, its potential energy is converted to kinetic energy as it falls due to the force of gravity. The potential energy is stored energy that comes from the object's position in the gravitational field, and it is converted to kinetic energy as the object gains speed upon hitting the ground.

So your payments would be bigger than your current payments, but you'd actually pay the loan off less quickly than you are now since more of your payments would be going towards interest instead of principal.\n\nUnless your interest rate is particularly high (like the double digits or something), what you're proposing seems counterproductive.

What is the explanation?\n\nThe jet stream is a high-altitude, strong wind system that typically flows from west to east in the mid-latitudes. The primary driver of the jet stream is the temperature difference between the polar and tropical regions. The polar regions are continually losing heat to space due to their large ice sheets, while the tropical regions absorb a large amount of solar radiation. This creates a temperature gradient, driving the air to flow from west to east.\n\nThe fact that it is about an hour quicker to cross Germany going north to south compared to east to west can be explained by the path and strength of the jet stream over Europe.",

Once the primary uses less water or the holding tank empties , the water will flow back .

Unfortunately, there is little definitive evidence for this theory, and it is more of a speculation at this point until more research is conducted.\n\nThe idea that the brain, or consciousness, may be operating on a fundamentally different level than classical physics has been a subject of much debate among scientists and philosophers for decades.

So , every macro state can have multiple microstates that contribute to that macro state . The greater the number of possible arrangements , the greater the entropy of the macro state. This also implies that the entropy of a closed system will always tend towards a maximum entropy value (maximizing the number of possible arrangements of the given set of microstates )\n\nDisorder comes into the picture because as the entropy of a system increases , the probability that it is in a state of high disorder also increases , since there are more microstates that contribute to high disorder states than low disorder ones .

The complexity increases drastically once you get into microcap territories, accounting fraud being on the top of this list, and thus, its much more difficult.\n\nRegarding your 2nd point, yes, my thesis is that its not about the numbers themselves, but about the way you look at them and interpret them that makes a difference.

In Cloonan's view index funds don't carry any transactional costs, they are the ultimate low cost investment.\n\nCloonan's explanation of how index funds are re-balanced and how the index maintenance rules are set up makes it clear that most of the benefits (low cost, low transactional costs, automatic rebalancing, tax efficiency) are the result of index fund structure rather than actively managed funds.\n\nIn my opinion low cost and low transactional costs should be the main considerations for individual investors.

Here\u2019s an article about an Australian hedge fund that was one of the early birds in using a little known indicator to buy into Tesla\u2026\n\n> On October 14, 2019, news broke that Tesla Inc. had received a record 472,626 orders for its new Model Y sports utility vehicle in the first 24 hours of its launch on the 13th. It was a significant market event for this high-growth stock, and for many traders who kept a close watch on the company, it represented a prime buying opportunity. However, for an Australian value-focused hedge fund based in Singapore, the event had been on its radar for several days before that.\n\n> Mosa",
        "These statements aren't necessarily contradictory. In the first case, investors are bearish because they anticipate selling in the future (because of the lower prices they see coming). In the second case, they are bearish because of a belief that the stocks in question are overpriced to begin with and will continue to be sold off. This is not a paradox, just a reminder that there are several reasons why people may choose to be bearish on stocks. It doesn't mean that bearishness is always related to a belief that prices will keep dropping, but it may be.\n\nIn the same vein, the idea that markets often \"overcorrect\" based on fear and/or greed doesn't necessarily mean that short-term bearishness (or bullishness) is always wrong. Over the long-term, markets may be more \"correct\" than not. But over the short-term, sentiment can impact prices significantly, regardless of",

One common type is a DC electric motor, it converts electrical energy into mechanical energy through the interaction between the electric motor's magnetic field and electric current in the motor windings.

Another common type of electric motor used in transportation is the AC induction motor, which converts AC power directly to mechanical",
        "One of the depth cues your brain uses to determine where things are located is called binocular disparity . Binocular disparity works by identifying the slight difference in angle between the two eyes. When you look at something straight ahead, both of your eyes should be aligned with each other. But as you look to one side, the image in your left eye shifts to the right, and the image in your right eye shifts to the left. The amount of this shift is the binocular disparity.\n\nThe brain processes this binocular disparity information and uses it to help determine the distance of an object. For example, when you look at a nearby object, the binocular disparity will be much greater than it would be if you looked at something that is farther away. This information, along with other depth cues, helps the brain create a 3D representation of the world around us.",

This response may also be influenced by cultural norms and values that emphasize the importance of caring for and nurturing children.\n\nOverall,",

        "If a lender could not charge interest on a loan , they would have no incentive to ever give out loans because they would be essentially throwing their money away. In addition, without interest, they would be unable to make a profit, which would make it difficult for them to stay in business. This is why interest is an essential component of any loan.\n\nThere are different ways that lenders calculate interest, and the specific method can vary depending",
        "It would be very unusual (and very erroneous) to have a company's stock be included in the Long Term Investments on the balance sheet AND in the Stockholders' Equity section. The Stockholders' Equity section, also known as Shareholders' Equity, includes items representing the owners' residual interest in the assets of the company after deducting its liabilities. Share capital (i.e., common and preferred stock) is a major component of Shareholders' Equity. The Long Term Investments section consists primarily of securities or other investments that the company holds, but the company also recognizes any gains or losses on those investments separate and apart from the investments themselves. Therefore, a company's stock is not a component of the Long Term Investments section. Instead, if a company holds its own stock as an investment, it is reported under the Long Term Investments section, and any gains or losses are reported under a separate line item",

Excerpt:\n\n> In this paper we present both theoretical and empirical evidence against the individual capacity of commercial banks to create money out of nothing, in the modern fiat money system. In this respect, our paper takes a critical look at the \u201cendogenous money\u201d approach, which is a widely accepted theory among post-Keynesian economists, and has found its way into some central banks\u2019 monetary policy texts and analyses. Based on this theory, banks are said to be able to create new loans and deposits at will, by extending credit to new borrowers or accepting deposit creations originating out of mutual adjustment, and thus generating new money as a byproduct. In our contribution, we demonstrate that this theory is incompatible with the reality that banks are fundamentally unable to create money; this is a",
