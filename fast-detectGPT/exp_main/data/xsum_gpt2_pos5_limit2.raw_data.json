Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack.

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and you need to stick to them.\" BHA media spokesman Robin",

On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand.

Inspectors, who said the force would be \"monitored closely\", returned in October and found it was not performing well compared to similar forces.

The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London.

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service.

Growing use of drones could have a significant impact on personal privacy, Prof David Dunn, a politician scientist from the University of Birmingham, told PA. \"Previously you had a hedge, you had a wall and you could do whatever you wanted in your garden without people disturbing you,\" he said. \"That has changed because of drones.\" Many of the reports logged by forces involved arguments caused by drones being flown over gardens or for long periods",

However, it highlighted confusion among spectators about ticketing and criticised steel fencing at the site. Among changes planned for this year's event is scrapping of evening entertainment. The four-day weekend event in July 2015, run by TeamOrigin Events, marked the opening stage of the sailing series as Sir Ben Ainslie Racing (BAR) began Britain's bid to win the 35th America's Cup. While the Saturday events attracted about 100,000 spectators, racing was cancelled and the public viewing areas evacuated due to bad weather on Sunday. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were among those disappointed as racing was abandoned and there was criticism on social media over spectator provision.

Massandra was Ukrainian government property before Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014. Any charges could not currently be pursued in Crimea, where Russia has full control. Russian media cited by Radio Free Europe reported that Berlusconi asked if he could sample the wine during a tour of Massandra. A witness said Massandra's new pro-Russian director Yanina Pavlenko in response uncorked a precious bottle of 1775 Jeres de la Frontera for her prestigious guests. Russian television last week showed Mr Berlusconi carefully surveying dust-covered bottles of wine while the Russian leader listened to Ms Pavlenko as she gave them the tour. Later, the Italian billionaire is seen looking at a bottle identified to be from the vintage of 1891, and asked in English: \"Is it possible to drink?\" The director replied: \"Yes.\" It is unclear what happened",

        "BBC One will show a special programme, Strictly Len Goodman, on Friday. The National Grid said the show would drive the biggest festive \"TV pickup\" - a sudden surge in electricity demand. The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme. There is also a surge in the number of people going to the bathroom, which leads to a spike in the use of water companies' pumps, which draw electricity. The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also expected to create high demand over the Christmas period. But TV surges create less demand now than they did 20 years ago because more people use catch-up services to watch TV and do not all see a programme live.

About 30 insurgents died in the attack, with Hamidullin the only survivor, while no American or Afghan soldiers were killed.

Mr Brazier, in a speech to the University of Liverpool's Institute for Risk and Uncertainty, added that this increase in debt was \"dangerous to borrowers, lenders and, most importantly from our perspective, everyone else in the economy\". He warned that High Street banks were at risk of entering \"a spiral of complacency\" about mounting consumer debt levels. \"Lending standards can go from responsible to reckless very quickly. \"The sorry fact is that as lenders think the risks they face are falling, the risks they - and the wider economy face - are actually growing,\" Mr Brazier added.

The team at Harvard Medical School said the unintended effect was \"disturbing\". Experts said similar changes had been seen in other countries. In 2003, there were concerns about an increased suicide risk from some antidepressants. It led to the US Food and Drug Administration changing the medicine warnings and widespread media reports. However, there was concern that the reports were exaggerated and missed out the benefits of antidepressants. The study, which followed 2.5 million teenagers and young adults between 2000 and 2010, showed an immediate impact of the warnings. Prescriptions fell by a third in teenagers and by a quarter in young adults. The number of suicide attempts increased by 22% in teenagers and 34% in young adults. Overall it led to an additional 77 attempts, the researchers estimated. The report concluded: \"It is disturbing that after the health advisories, warnings and",

Combined with other plant techniques, the team created drops that grew larger as temperatures increased. The authors say the development could significantly improve water harvesting and electricity generation. A little drop of water may seem insignificant but the physical processes involved in both the formation and movement of the liquid are essential to operation of thermal power plants, desalination and air conditioning systems. Condensation is also critical to the more fundamental function of gathering water for human use in dry climates, a growing, global issue.

        "Keeping older people at work can also boost wages for younger employees, argues Ros Altmann, the government-appointed champion for older workers. Her report suggests that extending working lives would add \u00c2\u00a355bn a year to the UK economy. If everyone worked one year longer, it would add 1% to annual GDP, she says. \"Academic and historical evidence shows that, far from damaging job prospects, keeping more older people in work is associated with rising employment and wages for younger people,\" said Dr Altmann, a former adviser to 10 Downing Street. If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone. Conversely, if older people stop work, there is less money in the economy, so fewer jobs. The idea is well-known to economists as the \"lump of labour fallacy\" - the false belief that the number of jobs in an economy is fixed.

        "Keeping older people at work can also boost wages for younger employees, argues Ros Altmann, the government-appointed champion for older workers. Her report suggests that if the benefits program is put in place, by 2030, workers might have to spend about $7 per hour just to afford health insurance benefits for themselves and their children, as well as to get through the transition through an in-work-at-Work program similar to that used in the 1990s. That might be too much help for older workers, and would not include the $14,700 yearly cost of a car and food supplement.\n\nAnother argument against expanding the program is that health reform isn't doing nearly enough. Some of these health care workers might lose work to illness and disability, but many will continue working just because their health insurance coverage doesn't match what the federal health care budget allows. Another argument, of course, is that some of these older workers get screwed by government mandates that increase their cost of paying or are",
