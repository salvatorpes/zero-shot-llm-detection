A discovery may sometimes be based on earlier discoveries, collaborations, or ideas. Some discoveries represent a radical breakthrough in knowledge or technology. New discoveries are acquired through various senses and are usually assimilated, merging with pre-existing knowledge and actions. Questioning is a major form of human thought and interpersonal communication, and plays a key role in discovery. Discoveries are often made due to questions.

The simple answer is that there is a lot of money to be made by charging fees to facilitate the trading of securities, but there are other factors at play here relating to new technologies.

There are a number of reasons for this rapid increase in volumes. Most significant would be the introduction of new technologies that allow for high volume, high frequency trading. This increase in activity has be accompanied by an increase in the number of stock exchanges.

With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved, and are often required to solve the largest and most complex problems.

This causes many bodily functions to slowly stop working like they are supposed to , and eventually stop working at all .",

This means that the bone structure of our hips is vastly different than most other animals . One side effect of this , is that the birth canal is much narrower for us than for other animals , and it also puts constraints on the size & position of the uterus .

        "In computer programming, a type system is a logical system comprising a set of rules that assigns a property called a type to every \"term\" (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Usually the terms are various constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions, or modules. A type system dictates the operations that can be performed on a term. For variables, the type system determines the allowed values of that term. Type systems formalize and enforce the otherwise implicit categories the programmer uses for algebraic data types, data structures, or other components (e.g. \"string\", \"array of float\", \"function returning boolean\"). Type systems are often specified as part of programming languages and built into interpreters and compilers, although the type system of a language can be extended by optional tools that perform added checks using the language's original type syntax and grammar. The main purpose of a type system in a programming language is to reduce possibilities for bugs in computer",

To be found liable for civil penalties , the standard is much lower and thus much easier to meet .

If we label each bean A , B , C , and D respectively , we will find that the most likely situation is to have two beans in each container . The least likely situation is to have all four beans in either of the containers .

Due to an excessive growth of these cells , more cells are being created every 24 hours ( or minute , whatever time period you choose ) , than die in that same period . This will create a lump . There are two main differentiations to make between cancers : benignent and malignant . Benignent means that the tumor is still located in one place , surrounded by a little film , if you will , that keeps it in place , and more importantly prevents the cells from getting out . Depending on where this is located , the prognosis for this is good ( it is possible to differentiate between the types with a microscopic sample , or biopt",

        "A Graph neural network (GNN) is a class of artificial neural networks for processing data that can be represented as graphs. In the more general subject of \"Geometric Deep Learning\", certain existing neural network architectures can be interpreted as GNNs operating on suitably defined graphs. Convolutional neural networks, in the context of computer vision, can be seen as a GNN applied to graphs structured as grids of pixels. Transformers, in the context of natural language processing, can be seen as GNNs applied to complete graphs whose nodes are words in a sentence. The key design element of GNNs is the use of pairwise message passing, such that graph nodes iteratively update their representations by exchanging information with their neighbors. Since their inception, several different GNN architectures have been proposed, which implement different flavors of message passing. As of 2022[update], whether it is possible to define GNN architectures \"going beyond\" message passing, or if every GNN can be built on",

There is no difference, economically, between the two situations. A foreign worker sending home remittances is no different from a local manufacturer exporting their products. Both are earning export dollars for themselves and their home countries. Is this a good thing or a bad thing? Clearly, the answer is yes - this is a good thing or a bad thing but we cannot know which in isolation. However, in general, foreign worker remittances are overwhelmingly beneficial for the host (which gets work done that otherwise would not be done) and the source (which gets export income. With reference to your particular question about local inflation, a rise in exports causes appreciation in the exchange rate i.e. local currency becomes more expensive with respect to (in this case) the Euro.

It's actually not possible for weights to be fixed, since different assets have different returns. So the weights are constantly changing as long as the market is moving. Usually after a certain period or a substantial market move, fund managers would rebalance and bring the weights back to a certain target. The target weights - what your question is really about - aren't necessarily the same as the initial weights, but often times they are. It depends on the objective of the ETF (which is stated in prospectus). In your example, if the manager drops the weight of the most volatile one, the returns of the ETF and the 5 stocks could be substantially different in the next period.

If the lymphadenitis is due to some kind of infection being spread by any of the draining areas like the lower limb, or genitalia, it might get smaller and relieved by anti inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, but there would be no effect on hernia by these.

The vertex of this parabola is at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a = 1 and b = 2, so the vertex is at x = -2/(2*1) = -1. Since the vertex is at x = -1, which is outside the interval [0,1], we must find the minimum value of f(x) on the interval [0,1].\n\nTo find the",

        "Why are there so many stock exchanges in the world? The simple answer is that there is a lot of money to be made by charging fees to companies that want to raise capital. However, it's not that straightforward. Each stock exchange has its own rules, regulations, and market participants, which makes it a complex system. So, why are there multiple exchanges? Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that stock exchanges act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers of securities. Companies raise capital by issuing stocks or other financial instruments, and investors buy these to earn returns. Exchanges provide a platform for these transactions. But why not have just one exchange? There must be several reasons.\n\nOne reason is geography. Companies operate in different regions or countries.

One of the main limitations is that the data can only be read or written one bit at a time. That is, you can't just read an entire block of data in one go, but have to read each bit individually. This is because the magnetic field is applied to the platter in a specific pattern, and each bit is read or written one at a time. So, this process is relatively slow.

So, it's about personal choice. But trends can influence preferences because if everyone is into something, it might shape what people prefer.\n\nNow, needs and wants. Needs are essential, like air to breathe or food. They're things you can't live without. Wants are things you desire",

If it's a cotton-poly blend, it might be more durable and less prone to shrinking. For outerwear, I should look for something like nylon or a waterproof material.\n\nNext, I should think about the fit. A well-fitting jacket will keep you warm without restricting your movement. Make sure the sleeves are not too tight or too long, and the jacket has a good length to cover your torso properly.\n\nThen, checking the features is important.

        "Most people say that entropy is the fact that disorder is ever increasing . While that is correct technically , it does n't really encapsulate the idea that entropy can also decrease in certain systems . So, perhaps I should think about what entropy really means in a more precise sense.\n\nFirst, let me recall that entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. In thermodynamics, it's particularly associated with the number of microstates that are possible for a given macrostate. The higher the entropy, the more microstates are accessible, leading to a higher disorder.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that entropy only increases over time in an isolated system. That is correct for a closed system, but what about open systems? In open systems, matter can be exchanged with the environment, so entropy can decrease if, for example, a system is being maintained in a certain order by external influences.\n\nWait, but isn't that a contradiction? If the system is exchanging matter with the environment, isn't",

But if the wing were its full shape all the time, the drag would be too much for the engines to handle, especially at lower speeds.\n\nSo, when flaps are not extended, the wing is more streamlined, which reduces drag. Therefore, the wing's design with flaps is a balance between generating enough lift and keeping drag within acceptable limits.\n\nAdditionally, the shape of the wing is designed so that air flows smoothly over it,",

        "The dividend quoted on a site like the one you linked to on Yahoo shows what 1 investor owning 1 share received from the company. It's an amount per share, which is then multiplied by the number of shares to get the total dividend. So, if the dividend per share is $2.50, and the investor owns 100 shares, the total dividend is $250.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the dividend per share is like the amount each share gives out, and multiplying that by how many shares you own gives the total dividend you receive.\n\nSo, if the dividend per share is $2.50 and you have 100 shares, you calculate 2.50 * 100 = 250. So, your total dividend is $250.\n\nThat seems straightforward. But let me make sure I understand why that's the case. Dividends are usually paid out as a certain amount per share, so each share gets a portion of the company's profits.",
        "Yield is the term used to describe how much income the bond will generate if the bond was purchased at a particular moment in time. If I purchase a bond, the yield is the return I can expect if I hold it until its maturity. However, bonds can also be sold before they mature, which can affect the yield. So, if I buy a bond and then sell it later, the yield on my investment would be the difference between the selling price and the purchase price, divided by the original purchase price. That's called the simple interest yield.\n\nBut wait, is that correct? Let me think. If I buy a bond for $100 and sell it for $110, the yield is $10 on $100, which is 10%. That seems straightforward. But when bonds are sold before maturity, the yield can be a bit tricky because the bond's market price can fluctuate based on interest rates. So, the yield isn't just the difference between the selling price and",

Well, GNNs can handle structured data, which is something that other neural networks can't do as effectively. For instance, text is a type of structured data, and traditional neural networks might struggle with the relationships between words, but GNNs can model these relationships more naturally.\n\nIn this article, I will explain the concept of graph neural networks, how they work, and the types of problems they can solve.

There's a lot of complexities here, but I'm trying to figure out the overall impact.\n\nSo, first, I need to understand what's being asked. The original question was about whether a person should produce locally or export. The answer was that it depends on several factors like demand, costs, labor, environmental impact, and national security. Now, the follow-up question is about a similar situation where instead of exporting, the person stays home and makes a widget. The question is whether this action would benefit their home country.\n\nLet me break this down.

If we can see our interconnectedness, we can reduce suffering.\n\nThe second root is the belief in inherent guilt or unworthiness. If we can accept ourselves as we are, without judgment, we can reduce suffering.\n\nThe third root is the view of life as a struggle for survival. If we can see life as a dance of relationships and abundance, we can reduce suffering.\n\nSo, the steps are: recognize",

Host hardware includes the CPU and RAM, which affect how fast the program runs and how much data it can handle at once.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how to make my program faster and use less memory. Let me think about each of these points.\n\nFirst, code efficiency. I remember that in programming, writing efficient code is key. So, maybe using loops instead of repeating the",

        "First, the stock does represent a share of ownership and if you have a different interpretation I'd like to see proof of that. Secondly, when you say \"it's not a contract,\" you're dismissing the entire concept of shares and ownership, which is fundamental to the nature of a corporation. I think you might be confusing stock with debt instruments like bonds. In a corporation, the stock represents ownership, whereas bonds represent a loan to the company. So, in that sense, stock is a contract that outlines the rights and obligations of the shareholder.\n\nAdditionally, I want to clarify that when a company issues stock, it's not the same as taking a loan. When a company takes a loan, it's a debt that must be repaid, but when it issues stock, it's issuing ownership in exchange for capital. The shareholders are not creditors; they are owners.

But even that definition is debated because some species can interbreed, and others can't. So, maybe it's better to say that a species is a group of organisms that are part of the same species if they can interbreed with each other under natural conditions, but there are exceptions and debates about this. Alternatively, another way to think about it is through the concept of reproductive isolation: two populations are considered the same species if they can interbreed and produce viable offspring, but if they can't, they're different species. However, there are cases where populations can't interbreed due to other factors, like physical barriers, and may still be considered the same species",

Let me try to think through this.\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to calculate the force exerted by a rocket's engine. I remember that rockets work by expelling mass, which creates a thrust. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas and how everything relates. Let me start by recalling some basic concepts.\n\nFirst, I think Newton's third law is involved here. That law states that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. So when a rocket expels gas, the gas pushes back on the rocket, which propels it forward. That makes sense. So the force exerted by the engine is related to the mass of the expelled gas and its velocity.\n\nI remember something about the rocket equation, which relates the change in velocity of the rocket to the exhaust velocity and the",
        "Information extraction (IE) is the task of automatically extracting structured information from unstructured and/or semi-structured machine-readable documents and other electronically represented sources. It is a common task in natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and data mining, with applications ranging from document classification, text summarization, question answering, and more.\n\nTo extract information, we can use various NLP techniques such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition (NER), and deep learning models like transformers. The goal is to identify relevant entities, relationships, and other structured data within the text.\n\nThere are different types of information extraction, such as:\n- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Extracting names of people, places, organizations, etc.\n- Relation Extraction: Extracting relationships between entities, e.g., \"Apple is owned by Apple Inc.\"\n- Entity Linking: Mapping entities in the text to external knowledge bases.\n- Fact Extraction: Extracting specific facts from text,",
        "One of the depth cues your brain uses to determine where things are located is called binocular disparity . Binocular disparity works by comparing the image of an object from one eye (the left) to the other eye (the right). If the object is closer, the image from the closer eye will be larger, and if the object is farther away, the image from the farther eye will be smaller. This helps your brain figure out depth perception.\n\nSo, if I were to create a 2D game or simulation, how would I model binocular disparity?\n\nFirst, I need to understand how binocular disparity works in real life. Let's say I have an object at a certain distance. The closer it is, the more it's magnified in one eye compared to the other. So, in the simulation, I need to represent this magnification difference between the two eyes.\n\nMaybe I can model each eye as a camera with a different field of view or resolution. If I have two",
        "I would imagine that it goes beyond purpose and also addresses the demographic as a poor credit risk. Those seeking a post secondary education are a poor credit risk because they might have high debt loads, or perhaps a history of not repaying loans, which can affect their credit score. So, perhaps the system is designed to limit access to those with bad credit, or alternatively, to offer them more expensive options. Hmm.\n\nWait, but the system is about providing access to postsecondary education, so maybe it's more about assessing the ability to repay student loans, which is a factor in credit scores. So, if someone has a history of not paying back loans, they might be considered a higher risk, which could make it harder for them to get more loans or could result in higher interest rates.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the system is explicitly about credit scores or if it's more about general financial assessments.

Like, \"the Ninth Circuit\" alone might be ambiguous if there are multiple circuits, but in reality, there's only one Ninth Circuit. So maybe the full name is just for emphasis or to make it clear.\n\nAlternatively, it could be that in some contexts, people refer to the Ninth Circuit without the \"United States Circuit Court of Appeals\" part, but when they want to be precise or formal, they include the full title.

So the room is filled with these tiny air bubbles, making it look like smoke, hence the name 'smoke' for the phenomenon. So the phenomenon is called 'smoke' because it looks like smoke, but it's actually just a room full",

        "It would be very unusual (and very erroneous) to have a company's stock be included in the Long Term Investments on the balance sheet. It is only included in the Short-Term Investments. So, maybe the problem is that the stock is not considered a long-term investment, but perhaps it is a short-term one.\n\nBut wait, I need to think about this more carefully. The classification of investments as long-term or short-term depends on the company's policy and the intended holding period. If the company is holding the stock for more than a year, it's considered a long-term investment. Otherwise, it's short-term.\n\nSo, if the stock is being held for less than a year, it's short-term, otherwise, it's long-term. Therefore, if the stock is included in Short-Term Investments, that suggests the company doesn't intend to hold it for the long term.\n\nBut the question is, why would a company hold its own stock? That is, why",

        "Neuroimaging is the use of quantitative (computational) techniques to study the structure and function of the central nervous system, developed as an imaging modality in the 20th century. It includes various techniques such as MRI, CT, PET, SPECT, and fMRI. These techniques allow for non-invasive observation of the brain in its various states, such as at rest, during cognitive tasks, or in response to stimuli.\n\nThe field of neuroimaging has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the areas of computational methods and data analysis. The increasing availability of high-resolution imaging data has facilitated the application of complex statistical models and machine learning algorithms to uncover patterns and relationships in brain imaging data. This has led to new insights into brain connectivity, functional organization, and the biological basis of mental health disorders.\n\nHowever, the complexity of these techniques also poses challenges. The sheer amount of data generated by modern neuroimaging methods can be",

So, if you get a ticket, you may not go to jail, but you might have to pay a fine.\n\nWait, but in some places, like in New York City, if you get a summons or a ticket for something like a broken elevator, or maybe a noise violation, you might have to go to court, but it's still a civil case, not a criminal one.\n\nSo, the key difference between a criminal offense and a civil offense is that criminal offenses are crimes against the state or public order, and can lead to criminal penalties like fines, imprisonment, etc. Civil offenses are more about private rights, and the penalties",
