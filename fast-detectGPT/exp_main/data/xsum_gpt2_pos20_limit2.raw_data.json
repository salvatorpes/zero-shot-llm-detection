Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger,",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack.",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat. It's simply what the rule says. The rules are the rules and",

On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head.

In the HMIC's Policing in Austerity: Meeting the Challenge report last year, Bedfordshire Police was judged to be \"requiring improvement\". Inspectors, who said the force would be \"monitored closely\", returned in October and found it was not performing well compared to similar forces.

The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT.

The news agency said the total number of drone incidents was likely to be higher than the figure it had given because not every force it contacted with its Freedom of Information request responded.

        "David Poole told Cardiff Crown Court he trapped Adnan Khalid, 27, who was charged with grooming a 14-year-old. Mr Poole, 38, was accused of giving misleading evidence in the trial of Mr Khalid, of Porth, Rhondda Cynon Taff. Judge Thomas Crowther QC entered a formal not guilty verdict and criticised the paedophile hunting group for the trial collapsing. Mr Poole, from Hereford, founded the group H Division and set up a fake profile on dating website Plenty of Fish claiming to be a 14-year-old called Chloe. He arranged to meet Mr Khalid in Cardiff after messaging him on Whatsapp and filmed the sting. Mr Khalid denied the offence and told police he believed he was speaking to a woman aged over 18. Mr Poole arrived four hours late to the trial and then said he had passed photo evidence to the police, before admitting this was not true. Judge Crowther said his answer was \"at best inaccurate and at worst a",

The four-day weekend event in July 2015, run by TeamOrigin Events, marked the opening stage of the sailing series as Sir Ben Ainslie Racing (BAR) began Britain's bid to win the 35th America's Cup. While the Saturday events attracted about 100,000 spectators, racing was cancelled and the public viewing areas evacuated due to bad weather on Sunday. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were among those disappointed as racing was abandoned and there was criticism on social media over spectator provision.

The review found there was \"inadequate resource management\" during the verification and count between 23 May and 25 May. Jenny Watson, chair of the Electoral Commission, said the problems were down to a \"failure in planning\". \"There were delays in getting counting staff and counting agents appointed by parties into the venue, then there were insufficient staff to be able to recover from that,\" she said. \"Fundamentally that meant a local election count that had planned to take six hours took 23 and a half hours.\" She said the commission would be monitoring the council's response to the review.

Russian media cited by Radio Free Europe reported that Berlusconi asked if he could sample the wine during a tour of Massandra. A witness said Massandra's new pro-Russian director Yanina Pavlenko in response uncorked a precious bottle of 1775 Jeres de la Frontera for her prestigious guests. Russian television last week showed Mr Berlusconi carefully surveying dust-covered bottles of wine while the Russian leader listened to Ms Pavlenko as she gave them the tour.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: \"Safe staffing across all our hospitals and care homes is a crucial priority. \"The temporary changes announced today will ensure the NHS has the nurses it needs to deliver the highest standards of care without having to rely on rip-off staffing agencies that cost the taxpayer billions of pounds a year.\" The announcement comes after leading NHS figures warned that \"stringent\" immigration rules are preventing them from getting enough nurses on wards in time for winter.

The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme. There is also a surge in the number of people going to the bathroom, which leads to a spike in the use of water companies' pumps, which draw electricity. The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also expected to create high demand over the Christmas period. But TV surges create less demand now than they did 20 years ago because more people use catch-up services to watch TV and do not all see a programme live.

The federation's Cuts Have Consequences campaign claims the Wiltshire force \"already has the lowest number of officers per member of the public\" in the UK.

Whiting added some of the controversial incidents last year related to this issue would potentially be treated differently were similar ones to occur in 2017. \"Before we said any move under braking would be investigated,\" Whiting said. \"Now, we have a simple, broad rule that says effectively if a driver moves erratically or goes unnecessarily slowly or behaves in a manner that could endanger another driver then he will be investigated.\" Whiting said the idea for a \"more general way of approaching things\" had come about as a result of a request from the teams, who are keen to have a more laissez-faire approach to policing",

Young people in Indonesia, amused by the local buses' customised horns, have been waiting by the side of the road for vehicles to pass, encouraging bus drivers to toot their horn when they did so. Videos depicting this craze have gone viral in Indonesia. Some held signs to better attract the attention of the driver - signs which said 'Om Telolet Om'. 'Telolet' is a word representing the sound of the buses' horns, while 'om' is a term for an older male, like 'uncle' or 'sir' in English.

President Francois Hollande says there is little doubt it was a terrorist act. But Mr Hamamy's father has challenged the French authorities' account of the incident. Reda al-Hamamy, a retired Egyptian police general, said his son was not a terrorist and accused the soldier who fired of \"using brute force with a poor young man\". French authorities say the suspect also shouted the Islamic phrase \"Allahu Akbar\" (\"God is greatest\") during the attack.

The 55-year-old is the first military prisoner from Afghanistan to be tried in a US federal court. Some of the charges carry a mandatory life sentence. About 30 insurgents died in the attack, with Hamidullin the only survivor, while no American or Afghan soldiers were killed. Hamidullin, who did not testify during the trial, is expected to be sentenced on 6 November. Lawyers say it is unusual for someone captured on the battlefield in Afghanistan to be transferred to the United States for trial in a federal court.

India signed a $3.5b (\u00a32.6b, \u20ac3.1b) deal for six Scorpene vessels in 2005. They are being built in cooperation with an Indian government-owned shipbuilder in Mumbai. India is investigating the leak to \"find out what has happened,\" Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar said. The Scorpene submarines are small-to-intermediate size vessels currently in use in Malaysia and Chile. Brazil is due to deploy the submarine type in 2018.

In contrast household incomes have risen by just 1.5%, he said. \"Household debt - like most things that are good in moderation - can be dangerous in excess\", Mr Brazier said. Mr Brazier, in a speech to the University of Liverpool's Institute for Risk and Uncertainty, added that this increase in debt was \"dangerous to borrowers, lenders and, most importantly from our perspective, everyone else in the economy\". He warned that High Street banks were at risk of entering \"a spiral of complacency\" about mounting consumer debt levels. \"Lending standards can go from responsible to reckless very quickly. \"The sorry fact is that as lenders think the risks they face are falling, the risks they - and the wider economy face - are actually growing,\" Mr Brazier added.",

The team at Harvard Medical School said the unintended effect was \"disturbing\". Experts said similar changes had been seen in other countries. In 2003, there were concerns about an increased suicide risk from some antidepressants. It led to the US Food and Drug Administration changing the medicine warnings and widespread media reports. However, there was concern that the reports were exaggerated and missed out the benefits of antidepressants. The study, which followed 2.5 million teenagers and young adults between 2000 and 2010, showed an immediate impact of the warnings. Prescriptions fell by a third in teenagers and by a quarter in young adults. The number of suicide attempts increased by 22% in teenagers and 34% in young adults. Overall it led to an additional 77 attempts, the researchers estimated. The report concluded: \"It is disturbing that after the health advisories, warnings",

But surveillance footage appears to show the 17-year-old being dragged away by plainclothes officers. Evidence suggests he was kneeling, faced down, when he was killed. Hundreds of mourners attended his funeral in the capital, Manila. Some held placards calling for an end to President Duterte's violent campaign. The drive has been supported by many who are fed up with drug-related crime in the Philippines. Nuns, priests and hundreds of children chanting \"justice for Kian, justice for all\" joined the cortege from a church to the cemetery where the boy was buried, Reuters news agency reports.

Combined with other plant techniques, the team created drops that grew larger as temperatures increased. The authors say the development could significantly improve water harvesting and electricity generation. A little drop of water may seem insignificant but the physical processes involved in both the formation and movement of the liquid are essential to operation of thermal power plants, desalination and air conditioning systems. Condensation is also critical to the more fundamental function of gathering water for human use in dry climates, a growing, global issue. Researchers have made previous attempts to mimic the remarkable abilities of the Namib beetle, which uses its bumpy shell to draw all the water it needs from periodic, foggy winds in the desert. The assumption until now has been that the surface chemistry of the beetle's back has been the key - but this new study says that it's actually the physical arrangement and",

Background - John Campbell, BBC News NI business editor The PSNI normally escort explosives when being brought to a quarry or mine in Northern Ireland. There will also be an explosives officer there during blasting. Their job is mainly about auditing the use of detonators - how many have been used, have the excess detonators been disposed off etc. This is something that has been happening for 40-plus years. But a typical quarry blast would only happen about twice a month. In a gold mine, explosives use is much more intense - blasting happens three or four times a week.

If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone. Conversely, if older people stop work, there is less money in the economy, so fewer jobs. The idea is well-known to economists as the \"lump of",
