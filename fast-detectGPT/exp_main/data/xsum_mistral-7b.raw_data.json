China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions",

The project involves Tata Steel, Swansea and Cardiff universities, and firms including BASF and Pilkington. More than half the funding is from the European Union. The technology being developed aims to enable homes, offices, shops and factories to generate, store and use their own solar energy. It involves creating innovative coatings for roofs, walls, steel and glass on buildings which can generate electricity. Scientists are also developing solar air collectors or steel \"skins\" which create cavities between the heated metal and the building to harness and store solar heat. They hope to create buildings which will not need a gas supply. One industrial unit in Port Talbot has already been generating all its own heat through solar power for the last three years.

If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone. Conversely, if older people stop work, there is less money in the economy, so fewer jobs.

The carpet was demonstrated at the Photon12 conference in Durham, UK. The optical fibre network at the heart of the effort makes use of the same types of fibres that transmit data to homes and across oceans, in which light bounces along the fibres' length. To make them sensitive to the deflection caused by pressure, the researchers carved grooves in the fibres along their length so that the bouncing of the light was less efficient at the point where pressure was applied.

        "The Antiquities Ministry said it had carried out scans to gather more information about the theory. Archaeologist Nicholas Reeves believes Tutankhamun's tomb consists of an outer and inner chamber. Reeves is convinced the burial chamber has yet to be found and the new scan theory could provide the evidence needed to reach that hidden grave. However, there remains considerable scepticism among other historians and Egyptology experts.

If Tutankhamun's tomb was indeed hidden within his existing burial chamber, it could offer a unique glimpse into the ancient Egyptians' funerary culture. However, it could also cause more damage to the fragile tomb, potentially destroying priceless antiquities along the way.

        "Dr Davide Dominoni believes that city lights convince the birds there is no end to the day. Robins are adapted to hunting insects in the dark, so they remain active all day if there is sufficient artificial light, but they are less effective at building nests at night because they need darkness to build sheltered, cup-shaped nests. Lights have a particularly pronounced effect on urban birds because they have been living in artificial light all their lives. For a robin, the lights of a city are as natural as the sun, so there is no instinctual drive to find a quiet, dark forest to breed.\n\nLight pollution is more than an annoyance to birdwatchers. It is a major driver of urbanisation and the loss of critical wildlife habitat. Birds are driven to build nests in urban areas because they are artificially lit, and humans may move in to exploit that habitat for their own purposes.\n\nLight pollution also has a",
