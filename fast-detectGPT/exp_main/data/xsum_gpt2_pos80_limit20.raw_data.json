        "Maj Richard Scott, 40, is accused of driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) in bad weather before the smash on a B-road in Wiltshire. Gareth Hicks, 24, suffered fatal injuries when the van he was asleep in was hit by Mr Scott's Audi A6. Maj Scott denies a charge of causing death by careless driving. Prosecutor Charles Gabb alleged the defendant, from Green Lane in Shepperton, Surrey, had crossed the carriageway of the 60mph-limit B390 in Shrewton near Amesbury. The weather was \"awful\" and there was strong wind and rain, he told jurors. He said Mr Scott's car was described as \"twitching\" and \"may have been aquaplaning\" before striking the first vehicle; a BMW driven by Craig Reed. Mr Scott's Audi then returned to his side of the road but crossed the carriageway again before colliding head-on with a Ford Transit van in which Mr Hicks was a passenger, the court was told. \"There",
        "The ban was backed by local authorities in Urumqi, state media reported. The move is the latest in a campaign against Islamic clothing and symbols in the mainly Muslim region. China's government has blamed Uighur militants for several recent attacks - but activists say the violence has been fuelled by Chinese repression. The Uighurs traditionally practice a moderate form of Islam. Recently, though, the influence of stricter forms of the faith from the Gulf and Pakistan has led to more women covering their faces. According to the BBC's Asia Pacific editor, Charles Scanlon, the Chinese authorities regard wearing an Islamic face veil as an act of defiance at a time of growing violence in the region. In August this year, the northern city of Karamay banned men with long beards from boarding buses. Some experts believe such restrictions could backfire at a time when many Uighurs believe their culture is under attack. James Leibold, an expert on China's",

Horses are only allowed to receive hay-feed or water before a race, but other substances such as electrolytes are permitted post-race. Employees of Palmer and fellow trainers, Francois Rohaut and and Jean-Claude Rouget, as well as the trainers themselves, were interviewed by stewards following a report by the Equine Welfare and Integrity Officer. Palmer is yet to hear what punishment the BHA will hand down. \"I imagine there will be a routine fine for a rule that's been broken,\" he told BBC Radio Berkshire. \"There's no suggestion that anyone was trying to seek an advantage or cheat.

But a disciplinary panel ruled contact with the pupil was probably made and her conduct had been \"unacceptable\". On Thursday, the Education Workforce Council imposed the suspension, saying: \"The public interest is in favour of her being able to teach again.\" Mrs Hungerford admitted shouting and slamming a book on the desk of the \"provocative and disruptive\" teenager as he listened to rap music in her classroom - but always denied hitting his head. She was cleared, on appeal, of a criminal charge for assaulting the pupil during a maths lesson for those with learning difficulties. But in November, a disciplinary panel found, on the balance of probabilities, she had made physical conduct with the pupil on the head or hand. The panel found she had \"acted in an inappropriate way\" and ruled it was professional",

She said:\"There are some who would say we have no right to remember or to honour them, we have absolutely every right. \"Everyone, it doesn't matter who you are, has the right to remember their dead in a respectful and dignified manner.\" The four IRA men were shot dead after attacking Coalisland police station.

It was the Royal couple's first visit to Northern Ireland's best known tourist attraction. The causeway formed when molten rock was forced up through fissures in the earth to form a lava plateau. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh then travelled to the nearby village of Bushmills to commemorate local soldier Robert Quigg. He won a Victoria Cross for bravery during the Battle of the Somme. Sgt Quigg was given the highest military award for valour after going out into the line of fire to search for his commanding officer. The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh unveiled a statue of the soldier as well as a commemorative stone. His grandnephew, Leonard Quigg, also gave a short address.

The report has also detailed a number of \"tests\" or benchmarks for the government's northern powerhouse scheme. Research by the IPPR showed only 47% of children born in the poorest families in the north of England achieved a good level of early years development compared with 59% in London.

Mr Parnaby said last year's event had attracted thousands of spectators to the East Riding. \"The council feels that the investment made by the authority, circa \u00a3100,000, to bring part of the race here is money well spent and will provide opportunities for local traders to capitalise on increased spending and help boost the East Riding economy,\" he said.

Mr Hunt wants to change junior doctors' contracts, which he says are \"unfair\". The BMA said its door was open to talks and blamed the strikes on Mr Hunt's \"shambolic mishandling\" of the matter. The dispute, which began in 2014 and centres around pay and weekend working, has led to strikes being held across England. The next is a 24-hour strike planned for Wednesday, when emergency care will only be provided from 08:00 GMT. Asking by Marr about low morale among junior doctors, Mr Hunt said: \"One of the reasons for that anger is that they were told by the BMA that their pay was going to be cut - it isn't. \"They were told that they were going to be asked to work longer hours - they aren't,\" he added. \"We",

But the Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said it would be \"dangerous and reckless\" to get rid of them permanently. The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has released three plans to make the savings. It insists no stations will close and no firefighters will be forced to leave their jobs. The Brigade said it had continued to meet London-wide attendance time targets while the 13 engines had been out of service.

The pair then shared an unbeaten partnership of 172 with Clark - batting at eight in the order - soon overtaking Chanderpaul's score, beating him to his half-century. The game was halted due to bad light in the evening session but that did nothing to halt Clark's progress. In total the 26-year-old - whose previous high score was 84 not out - hit 17 fours and three sixes in his innings. The change in fortunes for Lancashire was even more remarkable given",

Salil Shetty, Amnesty's secretary general, called for wealthier nations to take in many more people. Mr Shetty called the UK a \"sad example\" of the failure to take responsibility. The UK has accepted about 8,000 Syrian refugees since 2011, according to the UN. The US has taken just 12,000. And according to recent UN refugee agency data, no Syrian refugees have been resettled by China, Russia or any Gulf states. By comparison, Jordan, which has a GDP just 1.2% the size of the UK's, hosts nearly 655,000 Syrian refugees.

Drone-based complaints include invasions of privacy, disputes between neighbours, near misses with aircraft and prison smuggling, said PA. The news agency said the total number of drone incidents was likely to be higher than the figure it had given because not every force it contacted with its Freedom of Information request responded.

Judge Thomas Crowther QC entered a formal not guilty verdict and criticised the paedophile hunting group for the trial collapsing. Mr Poole, from Hereford, founded the group H Division and set up a fake profile on dating website Plenty of Fish claiming to be a 14-year-old called Chloe. He arranged to meet Mr Khalid in Cardiff after messaging him on Whatsapp and filmed the sting. Mr Khalid denied the offence and told police he believed he was speaking to a woman aged over 18. Mr Poole arrived four hours late to the trial and then said he had passed photo evidence to the police, before admitting this was not true.

However, it highlighted confusion among spectators about ticketing and criticised steel fencing at the site. Among changes planned for this year's event is scrapping of evening entertainment. The four-day weekend event in July 2015, run by TeamOrigin Events, marked the opening stage of the sailing series as Sir Ben Ainslie Racing (BAR) began Britain's bid to win the 35th America's Cup. While the Saturday events attracted about 100,000 spectators, racing was cancelled and the public viewing areas evacuated due to bad weather on Sunday. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were among those disappointed as racing was abandoned and there was criticism on social media over spectator provision.

The review found there was \"inadequate resource management\" during the verification and count between 23 May and 25 May. Jenny Watson, chair of the Electoral Commission, said the problems were down to a \"failure in planning\". \"There were delays in getting counting staff and counting agents appointed by parties into the venue, then there were insufficient staff to be able to recover from that,\" she said. \"Fundamentally that meant a local election count that had planned to take six hours took 23 and a half hours.\" She said the commission would be monitoring the council's response to the review.

Massandra was Ukrainian government property before Russia's annexation of Crimea in March 2014. Any charges could not currently be pursued in Crimea, where Russia has full control. Russian media cited by Radio Free Europe reported that Berlusconi asked if he could sample the wine during a tour of Massandra. A witness said Massandra's new pro-Russian director Yanina Pavlenko in response uncorked a precious bottle of 1775 Jeres de la Frontera for her prestigious guests. Russian television last week showed Mr Berlusconi carefully surveying dust-covered bottles of wine while the Russian leader listened to Ms Pavlenko as she gave them the tour.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: \"Safe staffing across all our hospitals and care homes is a crucial priority. \"The temporary changes announced today will ensure the NHS has the nurses it needs to deliver the highest standards of care without having to rely on rip-off staffing agencies that cost the taxpayer billions of pounds a year.\" The announcement comes after leading NHS figures warned that \"stringent\" immigration rules are preventing them from getting enough nurses on wards in time for winter.

The spike is largely down to viewers turning on lights and boiling their kettles straight after the programme. There is also a surge in the number of people going to the bathroom, which leads to a spike in the use of water companies' pumps, which draw electricity. The Great British Bake Off, the Strictly Christmas special and Call the Midwife are also expected to create high demand over the Christmas period. But TV surges create less demand now than they did 20 years ago because more people use catch-up services to watch TV and do not all see a programme live.

Whiting added some of the controversial incidents last year related to this issue would potentially be treated differently were similar ones to occur in 2017. \"Before we said any move under braking would be investigated,\" Whiting said. \"Now, we have a simple, broad rule that says effectively if a driver moves erratically or goes unnecessarily slowly or behaves in a manner that could endanger another driver then he will be investigated.\" Whiting said the idea for a \"more general way of approaching things\" had come about as a result of a request from the teams, who are keen to have a more laissez-faire approach",

However, the BHA insists it opposes other grounds for appeal and will effectively push for a retrial. \"Having received further details concerning the appeal, and having taken advice, we have decided not to contest the appeal on the grounds of apparent bias. We are still contesting the appeal on other grounds,\" said spokesman Robin Mounsey. \"Perceptions of fairness in relation to the structure and composition of our disciplinary panels is a legacy issue and we have already agreed to tackle this in our integrity review and have already started to review the structure and composition of disciplinary panels, appeal boards and our licensing committee. \"Our view is the most",

However, it is not yet clear which of them will be the presidential candidate. Mr Mugabe, 93, has been in power since independence from Britain in 1980 and has said he will seek re-election. \"This is just the beginning of the building blocks towards establishing a broad alliance to confront Zanu-PF between now and the next election,\" Mr Tsvangirai told journalists. The alliance is an important first step towards uniting a deeply divided opposition. And if this alliance succeeds it will be the first time President Mugabe has faced a united opposition on this scale since coming into power in 1980. At least a dozen parties are expected to be part of the coalition. Former Vice-President Joice Mujuru who was fired from the ruling Zanu-PF party in 2014 was the first to",

The team at Harvard Medical School said the unintended effect was \"disturbing\". Experts said similar changes had been seen in other countries. In 2003, there were concerns about an increased suicide risk from some antidepressants. It led to the US Food and Drug Administration changing the medicine warnings and widespread media reports. However, there was concern that the reports were exaggerated and missed out the benefits of antidepressants. The study, which followed 2.5 million teenagers and young adults between 2000 and 2010, showed an immediate impact of the warnings. Prescriptions fell by a third in teenagers and by a quarter in young adults. The number of suicide attempts increased by 22% in teenagers and 34% in young adults. Overall it led to an additional 77 attempts, the researchers estimated. The report concluded: \"It is disturbing that after the health",

There is a vacancy in the Supreme Court because former justice Antonin Scalia, a conservative, died earlier this year. Mr Trump has said undocumented immigrants in the US take jobs that US citizens could have. Controversially, he has also said repeatedly - although not in this speech - that he would build a wall on the southern border that Mexico would pay for, to stop Mexico's criminals and rapists from coming to the US.

But it said he did not see settlements as an \"impediment to peace\" - a departure from previous US positions. The fate of settlements in the occupied West Bank is one of the most contentious issues between Israel and the Palestinians. More than 600,000 Jews live in about 140 settlements built since Israel's 1967 occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. Israel's pro-settlement government, which had sharp differences with the Obama administration on the issue, felt emboldened when Donald Trump took office last month. Since then, it has authorised 6,000 new settlement homes, in one of the biggest surges for years.

It said some children had to be present during their parent's asylum interviews, often when abuse is disclosed to officials.

In March, a series of independent reports by academic Prof Dylan Jones-Evans, commissioned by Mrs Hart, recommended a development bank be created to make it easier for businesses to borrow money. He said it could be a \"catalyst and driving force\" to support small businesses and also help growth in the Welsh economy. It came after estimates showed there was a \u00c2\u00a3500m-a-year gap between what Welsh businesses wanted to borrow and what high street banks were willing to lend them.

Police said the pair were part of a larger group that was plotting the cyber-intrusion into the software giant's systems, seeking to steal customer data.

        "Keeping older people at work can also boost wages for younger employees, argues Ros Altmann, the government-appointed champion for older workers. Her report suggests that extending working lives would add \u00c2\u00a355bn a year to the UK economy. If everyone worked one year longer, it would add 1% to annual GDP, she says. \"Academic and historical evidence shows that, far from damaging job prospects, keeping more older people in work is associated with rising employment and wages for younger people,\" said Dr Altmann, a former adviser to 10 Downing Street. If older people keep working, the theory goes, they have more money to spend, and that boosts the economy, creating more jobs for everyone. Conversely, if older people stop work, there is less money in the economy, so fewer jobs. The idea is well-known to economists as the \"lump of labour fallacy\" - the false belief that the number of jobs in an economy is fixed. If the number of over-50s leaving the workforce continues at its present rate, the UK could suffer",

This seems likely however Maki Karzai to play both games as he moves directly within Karzai's camp.\n\nA vote for prime minister remains highly doubtful, while MPs voted early on, and Maimans opposed increasing the maximum term since the current minimums began falling less of a thumb towards 10 as they passed at just 6/22 or 1/0 than they did 14 14 was last changed 20 22 A vote rejected at almost 40% seems likely.

A subpoena was served on the college at the weekend demanding access to interviews about his IRA activities and other sensitive information. \"I didn't expect the authorities within that unit to be concerned until after the end of school,\" Stewart said via his email after Tuesday dinner. \"Of all the agencies involved when we decided if one wanted or were concerned whether its privacy or military interests can be justified, they chose never at all to do so. It was a tragic failure within military command where all resources expended as individuals \u2014 military and personnel \u2014 were essentially spent the following morning. While neither Army nor the military knows to if all military secrets must be disclosed,\" Col. Roger Young explained further from college. \"The consequences would mean some serious security oversight by others, and the Navy or Marine Guard would need considerable political authority over the public statements they make over emails, and most specifically they need support by key White House officials if given even the suspicion of getting",
