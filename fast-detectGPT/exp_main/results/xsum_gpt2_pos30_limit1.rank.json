Mr Buhari, 74, left for London nearly a month ago - his second trip to the UK for treatment this year. His absence has led to some anxiety in Nigeria, Africa's biggest economy, with people speculating about whether he will be able to resume his duties.

When he returned home in March, he hinted that he had undergone a blood transfusion, but did not disclose his illness.
