In recent times, the term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog, digital, mixed-mode analog/digital VLSI, and software systems that implement models of neural systems (for perception, motor control, or multisensory integration). The implementation of neuromorphic computing on the hardware level can be realized by oxide-based memristors, spintronic memories, threshold switches, transistors, among others. Training software-based neuromorphic systems of spiking neural networks can be achieved using error backpropagation, e.g., using Python based frameworks such as snnTorch,[10] or using canonical learning rules from the biological learning literature, e.g., using BindsNet.[11] A key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of individual neurons, circuits, applications, and overall architectures creates desirable computations, affects", "original_crit": -1.389329195022583, "sampled": "Neuromorphic engineering, also known as neuromorphic computing, is the use of electronic circuits to mimic neuro-biological architectures present in the nervous system of animals. Because neuromorphic architectures are usually hardware-constrained, computational complexity might be significantly lower than traditional classical computing but potentially higher than that of traditional cellular computing in humans. This is due to hardware constraints such as energy efficiency, communication and computation power, which are not present in cellular-based systems[@b1][@b2][@b3]. A major application of neuromorphic computing is for biological computation. For instance, an artificial intelligence agent can learn and adapt to its environment by adapting to its surrounding neuromechanical interactions. An example is the brain which learns a specific task when it interacts with a complex object like a cat's fur[@b4]. A key requirement to implement biological systems in neuromorphic hardware is computational power, namely the amount of computational time required for a computation to complete a given task.", "sampled_crit": -0.97930908203125}, {"original": "Larkin is considered one of the top players of his era, winning nine Silver Slugger awards and three Gold Glove awards .", "original_crit": -1.5806492567062378, "sampled": "Larkin is considered one of the top players of his era, winning nine Silver Slugger awards and three Gold Glove awards .", "sampled_crit": -1.5806492567062378}, {"original": "what do you mean exactly?
