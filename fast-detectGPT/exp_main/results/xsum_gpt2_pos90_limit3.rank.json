Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: \"Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this. \"It is important that we understand how social media use relates to these.
