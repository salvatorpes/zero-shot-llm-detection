Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.It could only be known by clinical examination of the lump by your family physician/general surgeon whether it is a lymph node or a hernia. A hernia would be reducible unless it has become irreducible, and also the location would be different. Straining might increase the size of a hernia, but would not cause any difference to a lymph node swelling. If the lymphadenitis is due to some kind of infection being spread by any of the draining areas like the lower limb, or genitalia, it might get smaller and relieved by anti inflammatory and antibiotic drugs, but there would be no effect on hernia by these. At the end I would advise you to get yourself assessed by your family physician or a general surgeon to be certain of the aetiology of the lump.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in", "original_crit": -10.749677658081055, "sampled": "Hi !
