Bamber challenged a refusal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) to refer his case back to the Court of Appeal as a miscarriage of justice. The CCRC, an independent body which investigates possible miscarriages, rejected Bamber's last appeal in April. The decision on Thursday follows a single judge rejecting Bamber's application for permission to seek judicial review of the CCRC's decision after he studied the case papers in private. Bamber made a renewed application dealt with by Sir John Thomas, president of the Queen's Bench Division, and Mr Justice Globe. Announcing the decision, Sir John said that having looked at the approach taken by the CCRC in the case he could not see \"any way\" in which a challenge could be made to the decision reached. \"It seems to me that a challenge is impossible to mount,\" he said.
