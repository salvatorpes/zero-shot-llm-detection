Mr Greene worked at Stratton Oakmont, the brokerage house founded by Jordan Belfort, played by DiCaprio. The judge granted Mr Greene's motion to compel a deposition in New York on Thursday, Hollywood Reporter said. The Wolf of Wall Street, directed by Martin Scorsese, saw DiCaprio play real-life swindling stockbroker Belfort and was based on his memoirs. Mr Greene is suing producers including Paramount Pictures, Red Granite Pictures, DiCaprio's Appian Way Productions and Sikelia Productions. The character of Nicky \"Rugrat\" Koskoff wore a toupee and was the subject of the movie line \"swear to God, I want to choke him to death\". He was played by PJ Byrne. Mr Green said the film changed his nickname from \"Wigwam\" to \"Rugrat,\" adding it spread untruths about him and that damages to his reputation",

Glasgow University researchers questioned 467 teenagers about their use of social media and state of mind. They found many felt a pressure to respond immediately to texts or posts. Lead researcher Dr Heather Cleland Woods and Holly Scott asked the teenagers about how and when they used social media. Sleep quality, self-esteem, anxiety, depression and the subjects' emotional investment in social media were also measured. This related to the pressure to be available 24/7 and any anxiety around, for example, not responding immediately to texts or posts. Dr Cleland Woods said: \"Adolescence can be a period of increased vulnerability for the onset of depression and anxiety, and poor sleep quality may contribute to this. \"It is important that we understand how social media use relates to these.
