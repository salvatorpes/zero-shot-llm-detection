It is expected that the government will make a loss of about \u00a31bn on the sale. Chancellor George Osborne signalled the move in his annual Mansion House speech in June. The UK owns 78.3% of RBS after bailing it out with about \u00a345.8bn of taxpayer cash in 2008. Its stake will fall to 73.2%. The government paid about 500p per share for its RBS stake. Shares in the bank closed on Monday at 337.6p, down 4.6p, valuing RBS at \u00a339bn. However, institutional investors may be able to buy the shares at a discount to Monday's closing price. One of the bookrunners said that shares would be priced at 330p. Mr Osborne said in June he was keen to start disposing of shares as soon as possible, and that he aimed to sell",
