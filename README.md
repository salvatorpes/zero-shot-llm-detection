# Reproducibility study of Fast-DetectGPT: Efficient Zero-Shot Detection of Machine-Generated Text via Conditional Probability Curvature

Code for the AI vs Human generated text Detection task using zero-shot approaches under the Deep Learning for DL4NLP course.

This repository contains reproduced results and following extensions:
1. Mistral-7B, Phi-2, and Deepseek-R1-distill-Lamma-8B introduced as new models.
2. Two new datasets tested: HC3 and xlsum underrepresented language (Scottish-Gaelic)
3. Adversarial attack on FastdetectGPT
4. Code adjustments allowing use of APIs
